# sorting_comparison
Use this code to compare sorting algorithms and plot the graphs for a visual output.
Before running the code on your machine, make sure that you close as many applications and background overheads.

The code uses the following libraries that you might need to install,
1. matplotlib
2. numpy
3. progress

During code runtime do not start or run other applications.

First run random_generator.py to generate a file with 1000 arrays of size 400 each.
Then run sort_comp.py and wait.
